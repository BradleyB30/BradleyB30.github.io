### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part-1 was my favorite. I learned how to use constructors to 
    execute code. I thought this was really interesting as we also looped through 
    vectors with it. 
* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because I always struggled with the usage
    of 2D vectors. Although after working with this lab, I learned how to
    effectively approach them. I also liked how we used the counties in the
    state we live in for the elements in the container.
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because of the usage of real world
    situations. Combining that with the usage of many if statements 
    to overall allow the code to run. This relation made this lab
    one of my favorites.
