### CPSC 120/Projects

* Bank Management System

    Designed a secure bank management system, incorporating robust functionalities 
    for seamless account creation, management, and modification. The system boasts 
    user-friendly features, enabling users to effortlessly check account balances, 
    conduct account searches by number, and access detailed account information. 
* Lab 5 part 1

    I contributed to a C++ program for the Decimal Feet to Feet & Inches lab.
    The code, divided into main and function files, prompts users for input and 
    performs decimal truncation for accurate conversions. 
* Lab 10 Part 2

    A program dedicated to organizing and retrieving California County population data. 
    Employing advanced data structure implementation, I utilized 2D vectors to efficiently 
    store crucial information, including county names and population figures. This use of 
    data structures enhances the program's ability to manage and access diverse datasets. 
    Results to retrieval of California County population data, showcasing a thoughtful 
    integration of data structures for optimal performance.

* Lab 7 Part 2

    The code implements a program for determining street parking allowance based on posted signs. 
    It includes functions for specific streets, such as CanParkOnAsh and CanParkOnBeech, each considering 
    factors like day, hour, and minute. The main function validates command line arguments and calls 
    the appropriate street function to determine if parking is allowed, printing the result.
